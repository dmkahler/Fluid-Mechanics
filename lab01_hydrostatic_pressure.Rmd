## Pressure on the Cannonsburg Dam  
As you have now found, the water pressure on a dam is can be determined based on the density of water and depth.  In our problems, we have examined a freshwater with a constant density.  In this laboratory activity, we will use instruments to measure the actual pressure and temperature of a water column behind Cannonsburg Dam, just south of Pittsburgh.  You will use the data collected to determine the total force on the dam.  The goal of the activity is to use a spreadsheet to compute a numerical integral of the pressure and to see the temperature dependence of the density at work.  

![Cannonsburg Lake Map, from TopoZone.com, data from USGS](fluid_figures/lab01_map.jpg)  

Based on the data provided, you shall use the temperature to verify the pressure measured and use the pressure measured to build a numerical integral of the force along the dam.  For this analysis, you may use the density/temperature table in your textbook to construct a continuous function that you may use in your analysis.

## Lab Write-up  
This will be an abbreviated report that includes a data section with the provided data, a methods section that summarizes your density calculations, a results section with your final analysis of resultant pressure, and a conclusions section.  In your conclusions section you should state your final result and sources of error.  Additionally, you should include in your conclusions any other factors, especially those that can easily be measured, that could influence density and include a brief discussion on how you could include this information.  The final product should be about one-page plus the data table, which may be submitted as an integrated table in Word or a separate Excel file (Numbers/Pages, Open Office, and Google Docs also accepted).
