## River Flow  
### 1 Mathematical Formulations  
Surface water is critically important for most water use.  The vast majority of agricultural and domestic water services draw from surface water resources.  Measuring these resources is typically a governmental responsibility.

Figure 9.1: A cutaway of a segment of river at an angle of $\phi$.  The forces are identified for the imaginary box in the center of the channel.

In hydrology, the most common way to estimate the flow in a river is with Manning’s formula.  Manning’s formula is empirical; however, it has roots in the energy equation.  Let’s consider a uniform segment of a channel (Figure 9.1).  The sum of the forces in the direction coincident with the flow reduces to:  

\begin{equation}
F_u - F_d - \tau P L + \gamma L A \sin{\phi} = 0  
\end{equation}  

where $F_u$ and $F_d$ are the hydrostatic forces at the upstream and downstream ends of the channel segment, respectively, $\tau$, is the shear stress on the bottom of the channel, $L$ is the length of the segment, $P$ is the perimeter, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $\gamma = \rho g$ is the specific weight of water, and $\phi$ is the slope angle.  Since theis segment is considered uniform, an important assumption, the hydrostatic forces are equal.  Since most bed slopes are small, we approximate the sine of the slope to be equal to the slope, $S_0$.  

\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{\gamma A L S_0}{P L}
\end{equation}  

The hydraulic radius is defined as the area divided by the wetted perimeter $R_H = \frac{A}{P_w}$.  The stress should be equal to the dynamic pressure, $\rho \frac{u^2}{2}$.  This is an equality that is common in hydraulics.  

\begin{equation}
k_1 \rho \frac{u^2}{2} = \gamma R_H S_0  
\end{equation}  

where $k_1$ is a proportionality constant, $\rho$ is the fluid density, and $V$ is the velocity.  In an alternative derivation, the Darcy-Weisbach equation is modified:

\begin{equation}
u = \sqrt{\frac{8 g}{f} R_H S_0}  
\end{equation}  

where $f$ is found by the Moody diagram.

*Example*: You are asked to find the flow rate of a river using the Darcy-Weisbach equation.  Your river is most similar to a rectangular channel, width of $10 m$ and a fairly uniform depth of $1.5 m$.  The bed is covered with medium rocks that you estimate to be $\varepsilon = 0.075 m$.  You measure the bed slope to be $S_0 = 0.1 \%$, or $S_0 = 0.001$.  Given this information, you calculate a roughness ratio of $\frac{\varepsilon}{D} = \frac{0.075}{1.5} = 0.05$ and estimate that the flow rate is about $Q = 3 \frac{m^3}{s}$.  Since the cross-sectional area of this rectangular channel is $A = 15 m^2$, the average velocity is $u = 0.2 m/s$.  This gives a $\mathrm{Re} = \frac{0.2 m/s \cdot 1.5 m}{10^{-6} m^2/s} = 0.3 \times 10^6 = 3 \times 10^5$.  Based on the Moody diagram, you notice something important as you find your friction factor: that you are in the fully developed turbulence range, and $f = 0.072$.  You also calculate the hydraulic radius as $R_H = \frac{A}{P} = \frac{15 m^2}{13 m} = 1.2 m$.  Based on this determination, you find a first estimage of velocity of:

\begin{equation}
u = \sqrt{\frac{8 g}{f} R_H S_0} = \sqrt{\frac{8 (10 m/s^2)}{0.072}\ (1.2)\ (0.001)} = 1.8 m/s  
\end{equation}  

This is even faster than estimated (and a fairly fast-moving river) and therefore would only move to the right on the Moody diagram.  Moving right on the Moody diagram once you have passed the fully developed turbulence mark does not change your estimate.  This means that your estimate of the friction factor is valid and the average velocity is $1.8 m/s$.  You will also note that this is a dimensional equation that requires SI units.  

In another formulation, Chezy defined a parameter, C, and stated:  

\begin{equation}
u = C \sqrt{R_H S_0}  
\end{equation}  

In yet another formulation, Manning wrote:  

\begin{equation}
u = \frac{R_H^q S_0^{1/2}}{n}  
\end{equation}  

where, in Manning’s formula uses $q = \frac{2}{3}$, $n$ is the Manning roughness coefficient, or Manning’s $n$ (Table), and these coefficients are valid for SI units.  This substitution is only valid for fully turbulent flows.  The condition for turbulence in Manning’s equation (values in meters):

\begin{equation}
1.1 \times 10^{-13} \leq n^6\ \sqrt{R_H\ S_0}  
\end{equation}

### 2 River Discharge Measurement  
There are several ways to measure discharge, also called flow, streamflow, or flow rate.  Sometimes, this quantity is also called stage or gauge/gage (conventional spelling/preferred United States Geological Survey spelling – both are correct); however, gage and stage actually refer to the height of a river.  

What are some methods to measure river flow?  What if you did not have access to instrumentation?  Such a list might include:  
* Placing a tracer (leaf, twig) on the surface and timing the travel along a measured distance  
* Measurement of water velocity with a current meter and numerical integration  
* Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)  
* Weir, either permanent or temporary  

Without any equipment, you can estimate discharge by getting a feel for the speed of the water.  Place a leaf or small stick in the river (as long as it is safe to do so and you will not interfere with anyone else’s use of the water).  Remember, if the tracer is in the center, you will not be measuring the average velocity, but the maximum velocity; up to twice the average velocity.  

With a current meter, the operator sets up a measuring tape across the river called a tag line.  This must be as level as possible because if it is sagging significantly, the position measurement will be further along than the actual position.  A rope strung tightly can help to keep the measuring tape straight, as the tape should not be tensioned too much (Figure C2).  Measuring tapes should be made out of fiberglass as cloth ones stretch and fatigue and metal ones change length with temperature.  Once measured, the discharge can be estimated through numerical integration of the measurements across the cross-section (Figure C3).

The most common method used by the USGS for measuring velocity is with a current meter. However, a variety of advanced equipment can also be used to sense stage and measure streamflow. In the simplest method, a current meter turns with the flow of the river or stream. The current meter is used to measure water velocity at predetermined points (subsections) along a marked line, suspended cableway, or bridge across a river or stream. The depth of the water is also measured at each point. These velocity and depth measurements are used to compute the total volume of water flowing past the line during a specific interval of time. Usually a river or stream will be measured at 25 to 30 regularly spaced locations across the river or stream.

The United States Geological Survey method uses rectangles with the average velocity measured in the center of the rectangle, typically called the mid-section method.  The ISO method constructs trapezoids to represent the cross-sectional area of the river, typically called mean-depth.  The velocity assigned to each trapezoid is the average of the velocity measured at each side of the trapezoid.  The numerical integration differences are analogous to the rectangular rule or the trapezoid rule from Riemann sums in calculus.  

Additionally, there are multiple different current meters.  Some of the most common instruments include the Price AA current meter (Figure C4, left), the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) (Figure C4, right), and electromagnetic induction (not shown).  

The acoustic Doppler current profiler is used for larger rivers where it is difficult to get in the water.  They are typically small boats that have the sensors mounted on the hull (Figure C5).  An ADCP performs a similar measurement to that of a current meter; however, because it does it in more places, the on-board software usually integrates the velocity across the cross-sectional area automatically.  

Weir methods include the sharp-crested, contracted rectangular notch weir (dam) that allows direct discharge measurement from depth based on empirical hydraulic relationships (3).

\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{2}{3}\ C_d\ B\ H^{\frac{3}{2}}\ \sqrt{2\ g}  
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
C_d = 0.60 + 0.083 \frac{H}{P}  
\end{equation} 

where $C_d$ is the discharge coefficient, an empirical constant that accounts for the friction loss of the notch, $B$ and $H$ are the width and height of the notch, respectively, $g$ is the gravitational constant, and $P$ is the height of the weir on the upstream side above the soil surface.  The equations are populated for SI units.  

For a V-notched weir, a similar equation is for $Z$ measured from the point of the V to the water surface.  The angle $\theta$ is the angle of the notch and the weir coefficient is $C_w \approx 0.43$.

\begin{equation}
Q = C_w\ Z\ \sqrt{g}\ \tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}   
\end{equation}  

Routine monitoring of river flow can occur without a weir.  

### 3 River Gages
One conventional method is to relate depth to discharge.  There are a couple of types of gages but the most common in the United States is the USGS bubbler.  A bubbler is a three-way tube that measures the pressure at the bottom of the river.  By hydrostatic pressure, the depth of the river is then determined: $p = gh$.  But that just gets you height; you still need to correlate that to discharge.  The general relationship between height and discharge was developed by the Leopold and Maddock in 1953.  They showed that the relationship looked something like this:  

\begin{equation}
d = c Q^f  
\end{equation}  

which means the formula must be calibrated.  There are a number of ways to generate the calibration, called a rating curve, but the most common are wading rod and current meter, which can be an impeller design, EM, or ADV, or a boat with an ADCP.  

The easiest way to access streamgages and other watershed information in the United States is through the [Streamstats Application](https://streamstats.usgs.gov/ss/).  You can also access water data directly from the [USGS National Water Information System (NWIS)](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis).  

The USGS StreamStats website is a convenient way to find watersheds and river gages (yes, a river gage is conventionally spelled without the “u” although gauge is also correct).  A typical river gage will report stage (height) and discharge (flow).  

### 4 Satellite Methods  
Leopold and Maddock (1953) actually developed three relationships for discharge; one for depth (above, the rating curve), one for velocity, and one for width:  

\begin{equation}
w = c Q^f  
\end{equation}  

One technique is to use the width measurements from satellites to determine a rating curve informed by data from an existing gage to plan for the traditional gage removal (Pavelsky, 2014).  A related technique is to use the width of the river with Manning's equation with other parameters measured by satellite (e.g., slope with InSAR) and an assumed parabolic bathymetric profile (Bjerklie, 2003).
